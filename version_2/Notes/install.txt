How to install:

- Download WAMP from "http://www.wampserver.com/en/" This will install the latest version of PHP, MYSQL, and APACHE
- Set up configuration for WAMP. For most cases, go to the wamp folder/ www/ index.php and open it. Change line 30 to true.
- Download this project (the latest version so V2), create a folder for this project, upload all the code files into this folder, then upload the folder into the www folder.
So it should be wamp/www/cse_310/#ourcode

- Now, under our project, open up process/config.php and make the password change. If you are downloading wamp for the first time, 
then your password will be empty, so change the password variable to ''; Do not add in a space unless your password is literally a 
space.

- Now, you have to add in the database tables. Look at the pictures and add EVERYTHING IN correctly or it will not work. If it's 
your first time on PHPMYADMIN, then the A_I checkbox means auto_increment, and the first 'id' per table should be primary to avoid
duplicates. 

- Once you added everything in, then the project will work.
