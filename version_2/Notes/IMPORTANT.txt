For this version to work, you must update the Database (PHPMYADMIN) or you will recieve errors. Look at the screenshot images

Also, delete all entrees from all the tables. So delete all your members, events, and events booked. Mainly because this system have
alot of upgraded features and some enhanced security (such as password hash). 

Updates
- Adding the images to the DB for events have not been added yet! 
- Unit Testing isn't added as well
