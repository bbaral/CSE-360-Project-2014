Functional Testing.

Notes
- Due to PHPBroswer having issues with php redirect and not being able to upload files, I couldn't test the add event function. 
- This project does not use any PHP Frameworks neither, so do not expect a broswer to pop up and show you what's happening. 
- You will need to make some changes to the testing files to ensure that their is a valid event to buy tickets from. View Below... 
- Since the project is testing new member's registrations and purchasing tickets, you will have to go to the files and change the username PER test to ensure 
that you are trying to purchase tickets for a valid event and you are not trying to add in an existed member. View Below... 

-MAKE SURE YOU CREATE AN EVENT BEFORE TESTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


- If you received errors then it's because of the variable being there but I doubt it will even happen. If so then you will have to manually replace the 
variables with strings in the code ($I->something). 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modified Files to Avoid Errors
- To avoid stupid errors such as in no tickets are able for purchasing or member already exist, you will have to make some key changes to the files.
- I tried to make things easy so all you have to do is edit the variables per file (edit all to make sure it's error free)
- All the files are located in /bin/tests/functional


Avoid Errors for BuyingEventsCept.php
	1. Open File
	2. Update the top 4 variables for registrating a member. Make sure the Username is not already registered, the email isn't registed and the password is 
		acceptable (so between 6 - 16 characters, so Testing24 is an ideal password) and make sure the password and password2 matches!

Avoid Errors for BuyingEvents_2Cept.php
	1. Open File
	2. Copy the user, email, and pass variables to this section. Also add in a new_username but make sure it doesn't ready exist.
	

Avoid Errors for BuyingEvents_3Cept.php
	1. Open File
	2. Copy all 4 variables from the buyingevents_2cept.php file to this section


Avoid Errors for ErrorCept.php
	1. Open File
	2. Make sure the email and pass variables are a wrong signin combination
	3. Make sure the user variable is an existing Username Name

Avoid Errors for the TestingCept.php
	1. Make sure you create an event
	2. Get a valid event ID. You can do this by going to PHPMYADMIN -> cse310 -> events -> event_id. The event must allow user to purchase atleast 4 tickets
		and have a good amount of tickets left. To make things easier, when creating an event, simply allow the max tickets to be 1000 and allow the user
		to purchase up to 10 tickets
	3. Update the email and pass variabels with a valid email + password combination to signin 
	4. Update the event_id variable with a valid event ID number

How to test?
	1. Know the directory of this project. So if it's under wamp/www/CSE_360_group11 then that's the directory of this project. 
	2. Open cmd 
	3. Type 'cd C:\wamp\www\CSE_360_group11\bin' 
	4. Type 'php codecept.phar run'
	5. This will run the code! 

Note
	1. I haven't tested this code on another machine, so I do not know if you have to install codecept.phar and phpunit.phar again but I doubt it since I already
installed it onto this project locally. If so then check out the videos online and install codecept.phar / phpunit.phar under the bin folder.
