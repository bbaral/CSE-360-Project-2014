How to Install Software )

	WAMP CONFIGURATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Download WAMP (for windows machines) if you haven't downloaded it before. (http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
	2. Set up configuration for WAMP. For most cases, go to the wamp folder/ www/ index.php and open it. Change line 30 to true.
	3. Enable mod_rewrite. 
		* Go to WAMP/BIN/APACHE/APACHE2.4.9/conf/httpd 
			NOTE - Your Apache Version may be different (APACHE2.5.1 for example), but it's fine. You will still see the conf folder.
		* Open up httpd (it's a conf file, so open in notepad)
		*On line 154 UNCOMMENT the line.
			So it will look like this #LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
			So remove the '#' so it will look like this LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
		* Save

	SOFTWARE INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Under Wamp / www, create a folder for the project. You can name it CSE_360_Group11 (it really doesn't matter on the name). 
		* So now it should be C:/wamp/www/CSE_360_Group11/ (or what you named it).
	2. Open up the Upload Folder and Upload the Files into the CSE_360_Group11 Folder. 
		* If uploaded correctly, you should be able to see C:/wamp/www/CSE_360_Group11/bin, etc... 
		* The root should have 6 Folders, 8 PHP Files, a .htaccess file, and a favico file
	3. Now, under our project, open up process/config.php and make the password change. If you are downloading wamp for the first time, 
		then your password will be empty, so change the password variable to ''; Do not add in a space unless your password is literally a space.
		If your password is not '' then make the correct password change. 
	4. Last thing to do is set up the MYSQLI DB!


	MySQL CONFIGURATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Now, you have to add in the database tables. Look at the images folder and add EVERYTHING IN correctly or it will not work. If it's 
		your first time on PHPMYADMIN, then the A_I checkbox means auto_increment, and the first 'id' per table should be primary to avoid duplicates. 
	2. If you do not know how to do this, then:
		* go to localhost -> click phpmyadmin (under Your Aliases) -> Click "new" -> The Name is 'cse310' 
		* Click cse310 
		* View the image folder and look at all the 3 images. The first image is events, so for the name of the table type 'events' and for the amount of 
			columns, type 14.
	3. Make sure to add in all 3 tables or ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK!!!


	How to Use
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Once everything is installed, then simply go to the project. So http://localhost/CSE_310/ (or whatever folder you named it). 
	2. If any DB errors are presented then checky you DB Tables to ensure that everything matches the images in the images folder.
